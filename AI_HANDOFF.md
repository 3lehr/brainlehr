## 2026-08-10T17:33:13+02:00 — feat(mcp): explain reference types at chat start

- Files: `knowledge_mcp_server.py`, `tests/test_version.py`
- Why: Every MCP-connected client should receive one canonical explanation of Brainlehr's four reference types when it initializes the server.
- Verified: `python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_version.py` — 5 passed.
- Remaining risk: MCP clients may ignore the optional `initialize.instructions` field; clients without Brainlehr MCP cannot receive it.
- Next test: Start fresh ChatGPT/Codex, Claude Code, and LM Studio chats and confirm each client surfaces the four-type explanation once.
